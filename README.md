This is a modified version of my previous project that I had completed earlier. A separate GitHub repository was created for this version and instead of making changes to existing is mainly because this version is using API written in Express.js which was not the case before. 

Please refer to this GitHub repository "https://github.com/neelJadav27/WindsAR" to get information about the application.

Additional steps are required to run the code locally. Cloning this repository and simply trying to run will result in some problems because the code is written to work with the Express.js server or you can call them API rather than static data. If you want to set up the server, please refer to "https://github.com/smitkumar-patel/windsarv2-API" GitHub repository where you will find code for APIs along with some instructions. You can also find APK in "APK" folder if you want to install the app.
